In this project I used Microsoft SQL Server to explore Covid19 data set from : https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths


-- looking at total cases vs total deaths. Shows likelihood of dying if you contract covid in United States------------------

select
	location
	,date
	,total_cases
	,total_deaths
	,(total_deaths/total_cases) * 100 as DeathPercentage
from CovidDeaths
where location = 'United States'

----------------- Looking at total cases vs popoulation in US, shows what % of population got covid------------------
select
	location
	,date
	,population
	,total_cases
	,(total_cases/population) *100 as PopRate
from CovidDeaths
where location = 'United States'

--------------what countries have highest infection rate compared to the population---------------------------------
select
	location
	,population
	,MAX(total_cases) as Highest_Infection_Count
	,MAX((total_cases/population)) *100 as Percent_Population_Infected
from CovidDeaths
where 
  continent is not null
group by 
  location, population
order by 
  4 desc;

-- ------------------showing ountries with the highest death count per population-----------------
select
	location
	--,population
	,MAX(total_deaths) as total_death_count
	--,MAX((total_deaths/population)) *100 as Death_Population_Rate
from CovidDeaths
where continent is not null
Group by location, population
order by 2 desc;

--------------------------breaking down by CONTINENT with highest death count per population---------------
FIRST QUERY I WROTE: 
select
	continent
	--,population
	,MAX(total_deaths) as total_death_count
	--,MAX((total_deaths/population)) *100 as Death_Population_Rate
from CovidDeaths
where continent is not null
Group by continent
order by 2 desc;
/* this query shows North America with total death count as 1127152, but doesn't include Canada's or Mexico's. 
 United states death count = 1127152. Canada = 53147. Mexico = 334336 **/

SO I adjusted and discovered location in dataset is also broken down by high, upper middle, lower middle and low income class groups.. interesting
select
	location
	--,population
	,MAX(total_deaths) as total_death_count
	--,MAX((total_deaths/population)) *100 as Death_Population_Rate
from CovidDeaths
where continent is null
Group by location
order by 2 desc;

------------------------looking at total population vs vaccinations-------------------------

	on  d.location = v.location

	----------------------------------USING CTE-------------------------------------

	and d.date = v.date
where 
	d.continent is not null
--order by 2,3
)
select
 location
 ,max(rolling_people_vaccinated) as total_vaccinated-- gives me the highest total number of people vaccinated at any point in time for each specific location.
