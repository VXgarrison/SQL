Healthcare database has 4 tables which represent doctors appointments in the provinces of Canada. The tables include information  
on patients, admissions(admission and discharge dates), doctors and province names. I explored the data using the following SQL 

#1. Show first name, last name and birthdate of all the patients that have a height over 160 and weight over 70.
SELECT 
  first_name,
  last_name, 
  birth_date  
FROM patients 
  WHERE height > 160 AND weight > 70; 
  
#2. Show patient_id and first_name from patients where their first_name start and ends with 's' and is at least 6 characters long. 
SELECT 
  patient_id, 
  first_name 
FROM patients 
WHERE  
  First_name LIKE 's%s'
  AND len(first_name) >= 6; 

#3. Show patient_id, first_name, last_name from patients whose diagnosis is 'Dementia'.
Select  
  patients.patient_id, 
  first_name, 
  last_name 
FROM patients 
JOIN admissions 
  ON patients.patient_id = admissions.patient_id 
WHERE diagnosis = 'Dementia' 

#4. Show patient_id, diagnosis from admissions. Find patients admitted multiple times for the same diagnosis. 
SELECT 
  patient_id, 
  diagnosis 
FROM admissions 
GROUP BY 
  patient_id, 
  diagnosis 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1; 

#5. Show all of the days of the month (1-31) and how many admission_dates occurred on that day. Sort by the day with most admissions to least admissions. 
SELECT 
  DAY(admission_date), 
  COUNT(admission_date) 
FROM admissions 
GROUP BY DAY(admission_date) 
ORDER BY COUNT(admission_date) desc; 

#6.Each admission costs $50 for patients without insurance, and $10 for patients with insurance. All patients with an even patient_id have insurance. 
Give each patient a 'Yes' if they have insurance, and a 'No' if they don't have insurance. Add up the admission_total cost for each has_insurance group.
SELECT 
CASE 
    WHEN patient_id % 2 = 0 THEN 'Yes' 
    ELSE 'No' 
END AS has_insurance, 
CASE  
  WHEN patient_id % 2 = 0 THEN COUNT(patient_id) * 10 
  ELSE COUNT(patient_id) * 50 
END AS cost_after_insurance 
FROM admissions 
GROUP BY has_insurance 

#7.  

Show the provinces that has more patients identified as 'M' than 'F'. Must only show full province_name 
SELECT pr.province_name
FROM patients pa
JOIN province_names pr 
    ON pa.province_id = pr.province_id
GROUP BY pr.province_name
HAVING
  SUM(gender = 'M') > SUM(gender = 'F');
