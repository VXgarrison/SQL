#1. Finding top traffic sources up until April 11, 2012 and breaking down by UTM source, campaign and referring domain. 
  SELECT 
	utm_source,
	utm_campaign,
	http_referer,
    COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id) as sessions
FROM website_sessions
WHERE  created_at < '2012-04-12'
GROUP BY 1,2,3
ORDER BY 4 DESC

#2. Analyzing traffic trends. Display number of sessions up until May 10th for gsearch nonbrand (utm source and campaign) and group by week start date
SELECT
-- Year(created_at) AS yr,
-- week(created_at) AS wk,
MIN(DATE(created_at)) as week_start_date,
COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id) as num_of_sessions
FROM website_sessions
WHERE created_at < '2012-05-10'
	AND utm_source = 'gsearch'
   	AND utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
group by Year(created_at), week(created_at) 

#3. Traffic Source Bid Optimization - Pulling conversion rates from website session to order and group by device type up until May 11th 2012
for the same Gsearch and nonbrand UTM source and campaign
SELECT
	ws.device_type, 
	COUNT(DISTINCT ws.website_session_id) as sessions,
	COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) as orders,
	COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id)/COUNT(DISTINCT ws.website_session_id) as convRate
FROM website_sessions ws
	LEFT JOIN orders o ON ws.website_session_id = o.website_session_id
WHERE ws.created_at < '2012-05-11'
	AND utm_source = 'gsearch'
    AND utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
GROUP BY 1

#4. Traffic Source Segment Trending - Looking at device level trends, if we are seeing more desktop or mobile traffic to the website. 
Display weekly trends for number of sessions for desktop and mobile from 4/15-06/09 2012
SELECT
	-- Year(created_at) AS yr,
	-- week(created_at) AS wk,
	MIN(DATE(created_at)) as week_start_date,
	COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN device_type = 'desktop' THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) as dtop_sessions,
	COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN device_type = 'mobile' THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) as mob_sessions
FROM website_sessions
WHERE created_at  BETWEEN '2012-04-15' AND '2012-06-09'
				AND utm_source = 'gsearch'
				AND utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
 GROUP BY Year(created_at), week(created_at) 
 
 #5. Doing entry page analysis in order to figure out where I should focus my energy on. I want to see which page of the website customers saw first (landing page).
 
 CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE first_pageview
SELECT 
	website_session_id,
    MIN(website_pageview_id) as MinPageViewID
FROM website_pageviews
WHERE website_pageview_id < 1000
GROUP BY 1;

SELECT 
website_pageviews.pageview_url as landingPage, -- aka 'Entry page'
COUNT(DISTINCT first_pageview.website_session_id) as NumberofSessions
FROM first_pageview
LEFT JOIN website_pageviews
	ON first_pageview.minPageViewID = website_pageviews.website_pageview_id
GROUP BY 1;

#6. Identifiying top website pages - I need to pull up most-viewed website pages, ranked by session volume before June 9th.
SELECT
pageview_URL,
COUNT(DISTINCT website_pageview_id) as PageViews
FROM website_pageviews
WHERE created_at < '2012-06-09'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC

--I want to analyze the performance of each of our top pages to look for improvement opportunities. What metrics would I look at and how would I be able
to pull those metrics from the database?

#7.
