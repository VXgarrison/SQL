Data Analysis and Business Intelligence Project – Using MySQL WorkBench 
I will be playing the role of a newly hired Database Analyst for Maven Fuzzy Factory,
an eCommerce start-up, and will be working directly with the CEO, Marketing Director and 
Website Manager to help grow the business and analyze performance along the way.

------------------------------------------SECTION ONE : ANALYZING TRAFFIC SOURCES --------------------------------------------------
#1. Finding top traffic sources and breaking down by UTM source, UTM Campaign and referring domain 
SELECT  
	utm_source, 
	utm_campaign, 
	http_referer, 
	COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id) as sessions 
FROM website_sessions 
WHERE  created_at < '2012-04-12' 
GROUP BY 1,2,3 
ORDER BY 4 DESC 
--  Based on this data, I should focus on the gsearch nonbrand and see what I can optimize here since it's our major traffic source.  
I need to see if these sessions are actually driving sales 
 

#2. We want to see the conversion rates from sessions to orders (what % of sessions convert to a sale for the company).
Display total sessions, orders and sessions_to_order_Conv_Rate, up until 4/14/2012 

SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT website_sessions.website_session_id) as TotalSessions,  
    COUNT(DISTINCT orders.order_id) AS TotalOrders,  
    COUNT(DISTINCT orders.order_id)/COUNT(DISTINCT website_sessions.website_session_id) as ConvRate 
FROM website_sessions 
LEFT JOIN orders 
	ON website_sessions.website_session_id = orders.website_session_id 
	
WHERE 	website_sessions.created_at < '2012-04-14' 
	AND utm_source = 'gsearch' 
    	AND utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'; 
-- Less than 4% conversion rate. I want my marketing director to bid down on these types of sessions. 

#3. Based on the conversion rate, marketing director bid down gsearch nonbrand  4/15/12. 
Now we need to display number of sessions up until May 10th for gsearch nonbrand (utm source and campaign) 
and group by week start date. We want to see if the bid changes caused volume to drop 

SELECT 
	-- Year(created_at) AS yr, 
	-- week(created_at) AS wk, 
	MIN(DATE(created_at)) as week_start_date, 
	COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id) as num_of_sessions 
FROM website_sessions 
WHERE 	created_at < '2012-05-10' 
	AND utm_source = 'gsearch' 
   	AND utm_campaign = 'nonbrand' 
GROUP BY Year(created_at), week(created_at); 
-- After running this query, looks like the number of sessions have dropped. 
I need to start thinking about how we can make the campaigns more efficient 
So we can increase the volume  

#4. Traffic Source bid optimization. Looking at conversion rates from session to order, by device type 
(mobile vs. Desktop) and see which performs better to decide if we need to bid up on either one to get more volume.  

SELECT 
	ws.device_type,  
	COUNT(DISTINCT ws.website_session_id) as sessions, 
	COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) as orders, 
	COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id)/COUNT(DISTINCT ws.website_session_id) as convRate 
FROM website_sessions ws 
	LEFT JOIN orders o ON ws.website_session_id = o.website_session_id 
WHERE	 ws.created_at < '2012-05-11' 
	AND utm_source = 'gsearch' 
	AND utm_campaign = 'nonbrand' 
GROUP BY 1 ;
-- So desktop sessions have 3.7% conversion rate and mobile only has 1%. 
-- We should increase our bids on desktop sessions since they have a higher conversion rate 

#5. Traffic Source Segment Trending - Looking at device level trends, we saw we had more desktop traffic compared to mobile.  
Display weekly trends for number of sessions for desktop and mobile from 4/15-06/09/2012 to see the impact of bidding down had on the volume.  

SELECT 
	-- Year(created_at) AS yr, 
	-- week(created_at) AS wk, 
	MIN(DATE(created_at)) as week_start_date, 
	COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN device_type = 'desktop' THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) as desktop_sessions, 
	COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN device_type = 'mobile' THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) as mobile_sessions 
FROM website_sessions 
WHERE 	created_at  BETWEEN '2012-04-15' AND '2012-06-09' 
	AND utm_source = 'gsearch' 
	AND utm_campaign = 'nonbrand' 
GROUP BY Year(created_at), week(created_at);
--Recommended to marketing director to increase desktop bids and we see increase in session volume. 


-------------------------------------SECTION TWO : ANALYZING WEBSITE PERFORMANCE --------------------------------------------

#1. I want to see list of the pageview_URLS and rank them by most session volume.  
SELECT  
    pageview_url,  
    COUNT(DISTINCT website_pageview_id) as pageviews 
FROM website_pageviews 
WHERE created_at < '2012-06-09' 
GROUP BY 1 
ORDER BY pageviews DESC;
--We can see from this query /home, /products and /the-original-mr-fuzzy get the most of our traffic  
--I'm going to be thinking about performing entry page analysis. 

#2. Doing entry page analysis in order to figure out where I should focus my energy on. 
I want to see which page of the website customers saw first (landing page) up till 6/9/12 and rank by volume.  

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE first_pageview 
SELECT  
	website_session_id, 
	MIN(website_pageview_id) as MinPageViewID 
FROM website_pageviews 
WHERE website_pageview_id < 1000 
GROUP BY 1; 

SELECT  
	website_pageviews.pageview_url as landingPage, -- aka 'Entry page' 
	COUNT(DISTINCT first_pageview.website_session_id) as NumberofSessions 
FROM first_pageview 
LEFT JOIN website_pageviews 
	ON first_pageview.minPageViewID = website_pageviews.website_pageview_id 
GROUP BY 1; 

--Up until this point in time, looks like ALL of our traffic is landing on the /home page. 
--Time to see how much of these sessions are actually landing sales for us.

#3. Calculating bounce rates: I need to pull up bounce rates for traffic landing on the homepage 
and display results as Sessions, Bounce Sessions and % of sessions that bounced (rate).  

Create temporary table Home4  
SELECT 
	pageview_url, 
	website_session_id, 
    MIN(website_pageview_id) as min_pageview_id 
FROM website_pageviews 
WHERE 	pageview_url = '/home'  
	AND created_at <'2012-06-14' 
GROUP BY 2; 

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE bounced_sessions4       
SELECT 
	home4.website_session_id, 
	home4.pageview_url as landingPage,

FROM home4 
LEFT JOIN website_pageviews 
	ON website_pageviews.website_session_id = home4.website_session_id 
GROUP BY 1,2

	COUNT(website_pageviews.website_pageview_id) = 1;  
	
SELECT 
    COUNT(home4.website_session_id) AS total_sessions, 
    COUNT(bounced_sessions4.website_session_id) AS total_bounceSessions, 
    COUNT(bounced_sessions4.website_session_id)/COUNT(home4.website_session_id) as BounceRate 
FROM home4 
    LEFT JOIN bounced_sessions4 
ON home4.website_session_id = bounced_sessions4.website_session_id; 

--Having our /home as the landing page we get the most sessions BUT 
We have ALMOST A 60% BOUNCE RATE. So that means 60% of our volume 
ONLY saw the home page and didn’t move on to any other pages/made a purchase. 
Website manager is going to put together a custom landing page (/lander-1), 
So we can make an experiment and compare /lander-1 with /home


#4.Analyzing landing page tests. I need to pull bounce rates for BOTH groups (/lander-1 , /home)

#5. LANDING PAGE TREND ANALYSIS. We have the 2nd pageURL called /lander-1 to see if we can get the bounce rates lower compared to the /home landing page 
(which they did have lower bounce rates) We want to pull the volume of (utmsource: gsearch) (utmcampaign nonbrand),
traffic on /home and /lander-1 pages, trended weekly from 6/1 - 8/31/2012 . ALSO need overall bounce rate trended weekly for this volume.
