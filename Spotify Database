For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.And then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
 

-- Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table. I explored the data using the following SQL. 

1. Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?
select
  artist_name
  ,popularity
from 
  spotifydata
order by 
  popularity desc
limit 10;

2. What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?

select
  track_name
  ,popularity
  ,avg(danceability) as average_danceability
from
  spotifydata
group by 
  track_name
order by 
  popularity desc
limit 10;

3. What is the average duration of tracks in the dataset
select
  avg(duration_ms) as avg_mili_sec
  ,(avg(duration_ms)/1000)/60 as avg_minutes  --I covereted duration_ms into minutes 
from spotifydata;
